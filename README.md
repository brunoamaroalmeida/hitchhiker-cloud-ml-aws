# Welcome to The Hitchhiker's Guide to AI & ML in AWS workshop!

# TL;DR;
This is a workshop tailored for technical folks without prior data science knowledge, to learn hands-on about AI and ML in AWS. Includes an overview of algorithms and the concepts of data collection and prep., and on a practical level AWS services such as: Sagemaker, Rekognition, Comprehend & Transcribe.

# Introduction  

AI and Machine Learning are key areas of investment, growth and differentiation for many companies. In recent years cloud technologies and managed services made building solutions using AI/ML affordable and easy to experiment with, propelling itâ€™s fast adoption and lowering the barrier to engineers and data enthusiasts.


In this workshop, tailored for engineer and other technical folks without prior data science knowledge, we will learn hands-on about AI and Machine Learning in AWS. We will have an overview of algorithms and the concepts of data collection and preparation. In a practical level, we will explore different AWS managed services for data science with different levels of abstraction,  such as AWS SageMaker - the AI/ML Platform - but also the pre-trained AI/ML model APIs with ready-made capabilities such as AWS Transcribe (Speech-to-Text), Rekognition ( Image & Video Classification) and Comprehend ( Sentiment Analysis ).


## What do you need for the workshop?

You need to have the following:

-   (required) An AWS account with a user with full rights (admin)
-   (preferred) Python 3 installed on your laptop
-   (preferred) AWS CLI installed on your laptop
-   (optional) a GitHub account
